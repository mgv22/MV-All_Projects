# MV-Projects

Past Projects that I have worked on both in and out of school.

The Machine Learning directory is filled with Kaggle Competition files and writeups.

The Supervised Learning and Applied Statistics directories are previous coursework.

The NFL Decisions directory is a NFL decision making project that was worked on as a Capstone Project. I was able to write all the code for this project while conceptualizing key concepts. The rmd files and .shiny files are located in this directory for this project. Open source data was used
